# CSC3150

The coursework of OS, hw3 and hw4 are modified from MIT xv6 2022 (mainly lab mmap and bigfile), and hw2 is a basic game implemented by multithreading, hw1 is modifing the linux kernel, quite novel to learn it. For final review, I recommend this blog of [NTHU OS course](https://hackmd.io/@Pl-eQT9CQaS0jhExKqL8_w/BkhOSR4jW/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2Fs%2FHyxV5P9hZ?type=book.)

All the coursework are full marks, including the bonus.
